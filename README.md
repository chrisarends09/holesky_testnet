ï»¿# Setup MetaMask to use Holesky Ethereum Testnet
We need to use MetaMask as it is seems to be working best connecting web3 wallets to the testnet in Edge or Chrome.

Goals:
1. Get HolETH for testing validators and staking and paying gas fees
2. Get HolSSV for testing funding validators and staking
3. Setup a validator on SSV.network
4. Setup an operator on SSV.network
5. Try out re-staking

Open your browser, Edge in this example, search for MetaMask add the extension and create new wallet, save seed words.
